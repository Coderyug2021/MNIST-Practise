# MNIST-Practise
Tried out 2 different models on the Popullar MNIST datset, as a practise for developing good CNNs and perfecting my skills you can have a look to these models.

One of them is ResNet Model (Custom) and other is a normal Deep(here shallow) model, both works extraordinary good and Normal Model performs better than the Custom Resnet.
